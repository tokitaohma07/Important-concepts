ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will be able to:
âœ… Write scripts with variables, loops, and conditions
âœ… Accept user input and process it
âœ… Automate script execution with cron jobs



ðŸŸ¢ 1. Variables and User Input

Concept:
Variables make scripts dynamic. User input makes scripts interactive.

Example:
#!/bin/bash
# greet.sh
echo "Enter your name:"
read NAME
echo "Hello $NAME, welcome to Day 3 training!"


Run:
```
chmod +x greet.sh
./greet.sh
```
