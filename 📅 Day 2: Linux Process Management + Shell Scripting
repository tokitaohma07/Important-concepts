ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will be able to:
âœ… View and manage running processes
âœ… Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
âœ… Write simple shell scripts for automation



ðŸŸ¢ 1. Process Management

Concept:
A process is a running program. You need to know how to find and control them.

Key Commands:
ps aux                 # Show all running processes
ps -ef                # Another format for process list
top                   # Interactive process monitor
htop                  # (if installed) Colorful top with sorting
kill <PID>            # Kill a process by its PID
kill -9 <PID>         # Force kill a process
jobs                  # Show background jobs
fg %1                 # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1                 # Resume job 1 in background



Practice:

Open one terminal, run ping google.com (it will run continuously)

In another terminal, use ps aux | grep ping to find its PID

Kill it using kill <PID>



ðŸ”µ 2. System Monitoring

Concept:
You need to check system health during incidents.

Key Commands:
free -h               # Check memory usage
df -h                 # Check disk space
uptime                # See load average
who                  # See logged-in users
uptime -p            # System uptime in human-readable format
iostat (if installed) # CPU/IO usage stats



Practice:

Find which partition is using the most disk space (df -h)

Check if memory is available (free -h)
