🎯 Learning Objective

By the end of today, you will be able to:
✅ Navigate Linux filesystem
✅ Manage files & directories
✅ View, search, and filter file content
✅ Understand permissions and modify them


🟢 1. Linux File System Basics

Concept:
Linux has a hierarchical directory structure. Everything starts from / (root).

Most Important Directories:

/home – User home directories

/etc – Configuration files

/var – Logs, variable data

/usr – Installed software

/bin, /sbin – System binaries


Commands to Practice:
pwd                  # Print working directory
ls                   # List files
ls -l                # Long listing format
ls -a                # Show hidden files
cd /etc              # Change directory to /etc
cd ~                 # Go back to home directory



🔵 2. File and Directory Operations

Concept:
Files are the smallest units in Linux. Directories hold files.

Commands to Practice:
touch file1.txt               # Create a file
mkdir devops_training         # Create directory
cp file1.txt file2.txt        # Copy file
mv file2.txt newfile.txt      # Rename / move file
rm newfile.txt                # Delete file
rmdir devops_training         # Remove empty directory



🟡 3. Viewing & Searching Files

Concept:
You often need to view logs or search text in large files.

Commands to Practice:
cat /etc/os-release           # View entire file
head -5 /etc/passwd           # View first 5 lines
tail -5 /etc/passwd           # View last 5 lines
tail -f /var/log/syslog       # Follow log in real-time
grep root /etc/passwd         # Search for 'root' in file
grep -i admin /etc/passwd     # Case-insensitive search


🔴 4. File Permissions

Concept:
Each file has permissions for:

User (u) – Owner

Group (g) – Group

Others (o) – Everyone else

Example:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 123 Sep 16 file1.txt

rw- → user has read, write

r-- → group has read

r-- → others have read

Commands to Practice:
ls -l file1.txt               # See permissions
chmod 644 file1.txt           # Set read/write for owner, read for others
chmod u+x file1.txt           # Add execute permission for user



📝 Mini Hands-On Task

Create a directory named day1_practice, then:

Inside it, create a file demo.txt and write your name into it.

Copy the file to backup.txt.

Change its permission so that only you can read/write, nobody else can access.

Search for your name inside the file using grep.

Delete the backup file.



🔍 Day 1 Mini-Quiz

Answer these in your own words (no need to be perfect, just to check recall):

What is the difference between ls and ls -l?

What does chmod 755 file.sh mean?

How do you check the current working directory?

Which command follows logs in real time?



✅ I’ve created a realistic sample log file for you:
📂 Download sample_syslog.log

🏋 Practice Tasks Using This Log File

Run these commands on your Linux terminal (or WSL/Git Bash if you’re on Windows):
# 1. See first 5 lines
head -5 sample_syslog.log

# 2. See last 5 lines
tail -5 sample_syslog.log

# 3. Follow logs in real time (simulate real-world)
tail -f sample_syslog.log

# 4. Search for all ERROR logs
grep "ERROR" sample_syslog.log

# 5. Search for logs related to payment-service
grep "payment-service" sample_syslog.log

# 6. Count how many lines have 'User login'
grep -c "User login" sample_syslog.log
